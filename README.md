# Time_serie_taxi_orders
ML model that predict the  the number of cab orders for the next hour based on historical data


### Project Description

Even Taxi has collected historical data on cab orders at airports. In order to attract more drivers during the peak period, we need to predict the number of cab orders for the next hour. Build a model for such a prediction.

The value of the *RMSE* metric on the test sample should be at most 48.

### Project Instructions

1. Load the data and resample it one hour at a time.
2. Analyze the data.
3. Train different models with different hyperparameters. Make a test sample size of 10% of the original data.
4. Check the data on the test sample and draw conclusions.
